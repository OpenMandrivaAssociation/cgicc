 - Provides string, integer, floating-point and single- and
   multiple-choice retrieval methods for form data.
 - Provides methods for saving and restoring CGI environments to aid
   in application debugging.
 - Provides full on-the-fly HTML generation capabilities, with support
   for cookies and file inclusion.
 - Supports HTTP file upload.

  [cgicc-3.0-1]
- Initial RPM build.
- Reworked to use the C++ standard template library. 
  In most places, the STL class string is used where bare char* was
  used before. The obsolete classes implementing linked lists are
  gone, replaced by the STL classes vector and iterator. 
- Include files are now installed in the package include directory 
  cgicc/ under the include/ directory, instead of in the
  include/ directory itself.
- Documentation changed to info format, and expanded.
- The test/ directory was renamed to demo/.
- The demo programs are no longer installed.
- The demo programs now contain internal stylesheet information, instead 
  of linking to an external stylesheet.
- Released as part of the GNU project under the GPL.
